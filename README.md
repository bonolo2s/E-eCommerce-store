# My E-Commerce Store

## Description
This is an e-commerce store developed as a practical project to test and demonstrate my skills in Reactjs.
While it's designed for selling products online, its primary purpose is to serve as a platform for me to apply and experiment with my underlying knowledge in these technologies.

##Motivations
I embarked on this project to explore the world of animations in React, understanding the nuances of dealing with the virtual DOM as opposed to the actual DOM.
I developed a unique way to animate components, learned about state management, and navigated the decision-making process between using Redux or React's 
built-in state management tools. I also gained experience with React Router, props, lifting up state to avoid prop drilling, and creating multiple frontend pages using the single-page app React library.

## Features
- Product listing: Displays a list of available products for purchase.
- Shopping cart: Allows users to add products to a shopping cart and view the total price before purchase.
- Payment API: Consumes a payment API to handle transactions.
